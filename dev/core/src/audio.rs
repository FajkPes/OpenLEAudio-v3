    /// - a mute from the earcups mutes the cable, which silences every program
    ///   on the PC rather than the headphones;
    /// - and neither survives only as long as the connection. The level and the
    ///   mute are properties of a Windows endpoint, so they stay exactly where
    ///   the headphones last left them after the headphones are gone - which is
    ///   how background audio ends up silent, and stays silent, with nothing in
    ///   the program still running to explain it.
    ///

    /// longer written anywhere it can do damage.
