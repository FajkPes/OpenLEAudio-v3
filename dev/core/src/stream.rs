//! Turning capabilities into a running audio stream.

//! Given what the headphones advertised and which preset the user picked, this

//!
//! ```text
//!   Config Codec -> Config QoS -> Enable -> CIG/CIS -> ISO data path -> Streaming
//! ```

//! The topology decision lives here too. A headset that can carry both channels
