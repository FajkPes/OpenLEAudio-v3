//! USB transport for a Bluetooth controller, per Core Specification Vol 4 Part B.
//!
//! A Bluetooth USB controller exposes a fixed layout on interface 0:
//!
//! | Channel      | Endpoint                                    |
//! |--------------|---------------------------------------------|
//! | HCI commands | control OUT, class request to the interface |
//! | HCI events   | interrupt IN                                |
//! | ACL data     | bulk IN / bulk OUT                          |
//!
//! Because that layout is standardised, this module works against any adapter
//! bound to WinUSB - there is no per-vendor code here and no firmware loading,
//! since the controller was already initialised by its original driver before
//! we took the interface.
