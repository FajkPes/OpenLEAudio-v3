//! Records what the virtual cable actually delivers, so it can be judged by ear.
//!
//! Every measurement so far has been of our own numbers. This one leaves a file
//! behind: a WAV of exactly the samples the stack would have encoded, playable
//! on any speakers. If that file sounds like proper stereo with bass, the cable
//! is faithful and the fault is past it. If it sounds thin or mono, the problem
//! is in how Windows is feeding the cable and Bluetooth was never involved.
//!
//! The report beside it says the same thing in numbers, including the one that
//! settles it: the correlation between the two channels. Two channels carrying
//! the same audio correlate at 1.0 however loud each of them is, which is the
//! case level meters cannot tell apart from real stereo.
