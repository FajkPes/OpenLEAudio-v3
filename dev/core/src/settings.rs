//! Settings that survive a restart, and what each one costs to change.
//!
//! Two things the configuration app needs and cannot work out for itself.
//!
//! The first is persistence: a preference set once should still be there after
//! the headphones drop out and reconnect, and after the app is closed and
//! opened again.
//!
//! The second is honesty about when a change takes effect. Some settings apply
//! to the next audio frame. Some are baked into the stream when it is set up,
//! so the headphones have to be reconnected. A stack that silently does nothing
//! until the next reconnect teaches people to distrust every control on the
//! page, so each setting carries its scope and the app can say so out loud.
//!
//! Deliberately a plain `key = value` text file. It can be read, diffed and
//! repaired in Notepad, which matters more here than compactness: this is a file
//! people will want to look at when something behaves oddly.
