//! Whether a headset is already busy with someone else, asked the standard way.
//!
//! "Multipoint" is a marketing word for a peripheral holding connections to two
//! hosts at once. It is worth being precise about where the control over it
//! actually lives, because the answer decides what this stack can honestly
//! offer.
//!
//! It is a **peripheral-side** feature. Nothing in BAP, ASCS, PACS or any other
//! adopted profile lets a host enable it, disable it, or ask a headset to switch
//! to it. Every vendor that exposes those controls does so through its own
//! protocol on its own characteristic, which means a switch built that way works
//! on exactly one brand - the opposite of what this project is for, and behind a
//! safety boundary that deliberately blocks vendor-specific traffic.
//!
//! What *is* standard, and what this module uses:
//!
//! - **Available Audio Contexts** (PACS, 0x2BCD). A device publishes which
//!   contexts it can accept at this moment, as distinct from the ones it
//!   supports in principle. A headset already streaming from a phone withdraws
//!   Media from its available set, and restores it when the phone stops. This is
//!   the only vendor-neutral way to know a second host is in the picture.
//!
//! - **Taking over by asking.** The specified way for a host to start playing is
//!   to configure its ASEs and send Enable. On a device that supports
//!   multipoint, that is also how the switch happens - there is no separate
//!   handover operation to send. So "make the headphones switch to this PC" is
//!   not a missing feature; it is the ordinary connect path, and it either works
//!   or the device tells us it will not.
//!
//! - **Giving the other host a turn.** Releasing our ASEs while leaving the ACL
//!   connection up is what lets the other device play without us having to
//!   disconnect. That is multipoint behaving correctly from our side, and it
//!   costs nothing but a Release.
//!
//! So the useful thing to build is not a switch. It is knowing, and saying,
//! which of these three states the headset is in - because today a headset busy
//! with a phone produces a stream-setup failure that reads as broken hardware.
