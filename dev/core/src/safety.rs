//! Guards that sit between the stack and the hardware.
//!

//! send the wrong bytes.
//!
//! What is actually at risk, honestly assessed:
//!
//! - **The adapter cannot be physically damaged by HCI traffic.** Firmware is
//!   loaded by its original driver before we take the interface, and we never
//!   send vendor-specific commands, which is where flashing would live. The
//!   worst case is a confused controller, cured by unplugging it.
//! - **The headphones cannot be reflashed over ASCS.** We write to one control
//!   point and stream audio. There is no firmware characteristic in that path.
//! - **Hearing is the real risk.** A corrupted LC3 frame decodes to full-scale
//!   noise. That is why the output limiter below is not optional.

/// Opcode groups the stack is permitted to send.
