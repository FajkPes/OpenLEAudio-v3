//! What has to be true before any of this can work, checked out loud.
//!
//! Three things have to be in place before a single LC3 frame can reach a pair
//! of headphones: the adapter has to belong to this stack rather than to
//! Windows, a virtual cable has to exist, and that cable has to be both
//! configured and actually receiving the music.
//!
//! Every one of them can be wrong in a way that produces no error at all. An
//! adapter still bound to the Microsoft Bluetooth stack simply is not found. A
//! VB-CABLE left at its default 44.1 kHz is present in every device list and
//! quietly costs a resample on every frame. A cable that is not the default
//! playback device works perfectly and carries silence, because the music is
//! going somewhere else.
//!
//! Each of those has, at some point, been diagnosed as a codec fault, a radio
//! fault, or broken headphones. So they are checked explicitly, named in plain
//! language, and each one says what to do about it.
