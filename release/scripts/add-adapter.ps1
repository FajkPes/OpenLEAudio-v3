.SYNOPSIS
    Teaches the OpenLEAudio driver package about another Bluetooth adapter.

.DESCRIPTION
    The stack drives its adapter through WinUSB, and WinUSB has to be bound to a
    named device. The INF therefore lists adapters by hardware ID, one line each,
    and it ships with only the one this project was developed against.

    This script adds the ones actually plugged into this machine.

    It does not guess. Every ID written to the INF is read out of Windows' own
    device enumeration, filtered to the USB Bluetooth class - so it can only ever
    name a real Bluetooth controller that is really present. That is the whole
    reason the INF is not simply matched against the device class instead:
    matching the class would claim every Bluetooth radio in the machine, and
    somebody with one radio would be left with no Bluetooth and no obvious way
    back.

    Adding an adapter does not switch anything. It only makes the adapter
    selectable; switching it over is still a separate, confirmed step.

.PARAMETER HardwareId
    Add one specific ID, e.g. 'USB\VID_8087&PID_0032'. Without it, every present
    controller missing from the INF is offered one at a time.

.PARAMETER All
    Add every present controller without asking about each one.

.PARAMETER NoSign
    Skip re-signing. Useful when several adapters are added in a row and the
    signature is refreshed once at the end.

.NOTES
    The catalog is signed against the INF, so changing the INF invalidates the
    signature. This script re-runs the signing step for you; that needs
    administrator rights and test signing enabled, exactly as the first install
    did.
