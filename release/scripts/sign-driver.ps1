.SYNOPSIS
    Signs the WinUSB INF so Windows will install it.

.DESCRIPTION
    Windows refuses unsigned driver packages. The binary being installed is
    Microsoft's own WinUSB.sys - we only supply the INF that points a device at
    it - so a self-signed certificate is enough. This is exactly how Zadig and
    similar tools work, and it does not require test signing or touching Secure
    Boot.

    WHAT THIS CHANGES ON YOUR MACHINE:
      - Creates a non-exportable, administrator-owned code signing certificate
        named "OpenLEAudio Driver Signing"
      - Installs it into Trusted Root and Trusted Publishers (machine store)

    That means Windows will trust anything signed with THAT certificate. The
    private key is non-exportable in the machine certificate store. It is still
    a real trust decision. The adapter binding script removes the temporary
    trust and private key after the signed driver package is installed.

.PARAMETER Sign
    Creates the certificate if needed, builds the catalog and signs it.

.PARAMETER Remove
    Removes the certificate from both stores. The driver stays installed until
    you also run the adapter restore.

.PARAMETER Status
    Shows whether the certificate exists and whether the catalog is signed.
