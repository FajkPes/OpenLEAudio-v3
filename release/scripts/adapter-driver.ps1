.SYNOPSIS
    Binds a Bluetooth adapter to WinUSB for the OpenLEAudio stack, and puts it back.

.DESCRIPTION
    Rebinding is only safe if the way back is safe, so restore is the primary feature
    here, not an afterthought. Before anything changes, the current driver binding is
    written to a state file next to this script. Restore reads that file; if it is
    missing or damaged, the fallback still works, because removing the device makes
    Windows reinstall the original driver from its own driver store on the next scan.

    Nothing here runs unless you ask for it explicitly. -Status is read-only and is
    the default.

.PARAMETER Status
    Shows the current binding. Read-only. This is the default action.

.PARAMETER Bind
    Switches the adapter to WinUSB. Requires elevation. Windows Bluetooth stops
    working through this adapter until you restore it or the stack takes over.

.PARAMETER Restore
    Puts the original driver back. Requires elevation.

.PARAMETER HardwareId
    Which adapter to act on. Defaults to the ASUS USB-BT600.

.EXAMPLE
    .\adapter-driver.ps1 -Status
    .\adapter-driver.ps1 -Restore
